**This is a tutorial repository for basic examples of TensorFlow and Neural Networks**

You can find most of these approaches in the internet as well. I tried reducing the libraries and moving parts used in the codes in order to maintain the forward-compatibility of the repository.
Some of these codes are assignments are for ce959-1: Deep Learning at Sharif University of Technology
